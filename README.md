### Hi there 👋

I'm Moxie, welcome to my github!
Note that this is isn't an offical nomnomnami account, nor am I associated with them.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning `Haxe, C, C++, C#, JS (Javascript), Java, and Python`
- 📫 How to reach me: moxiethespecialist (on discord)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/They/Them
- 🔭 I’m currently working on FNF mods and Other Projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with coding (in C#/C++)
- I make discord bots sometimes, starting to learn how to mod some games like Mario 64

- If you're wondering where some of my haxe/FnF or other repos are, they're now [here](https://github.com/MemeHovy-Stuff).
- I usually might move my stuff to organizations or such just to declutter my profile.
