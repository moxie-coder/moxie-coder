### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Moxie, welcome to my Github!
Note that this is isn't an offical NomNomNami account, nor am I associated with her. I'm just a big fan of her & her work!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `Haxe, C, C++, C#, JS (Javascript), Java, and Python`
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: moxiedev (on discord)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/They/Them
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on FNF mods and Other Projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding (in C#/C++)
- I make discord bots sometimes, starting to learn how to mod some games like Mario 64
- I use Windows, and Linux (yes, including Arch)

- If you're wondering where some of my haxe/FnF or other repos are, they're now [here](https://github.com/Moxie-Stuff).
- I usually might move my stuff to organizations or such just to declutter my profile.
